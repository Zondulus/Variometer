Variometer adds the functionality of a real-world variometer to Kerbal Space Program. Intended for use with RidgeLift or KerbalSoaring, Variometer provides audio feedback based on the movement of the air around the vessel itself.

An intermittent beeping tone scales with the velocity of rising air experienced in a thermal or mountain wave, while a descending continuous tone sounds when encountering sinking air. A stock toolbar button allows turning the sound on or off.
